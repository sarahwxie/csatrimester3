# Week 0 Review
This week, we created team and individual github pages. I created a Wiki, and planned my project with my team. I also reviewed what I learned last trimester via a reflection. We discussed the value of collaboration with computer science, and I learned about how planning out a project beforehand can help with collaboration and implementations of projects.

We determined who we want our sponsor to be (Mr. Eckman) and we created a design plan that can be found [here](https://unblocked00.github.io/swagketo/web).
