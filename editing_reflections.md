# What can I do with Tech to improve mine or others education?

I can use tech to improve my education and other's education by implementing it in a positive way. For example, our previous project, TutorVUE helped students who were having trouble in class to study and obtain personalized tutoring from qualified individuals. In this way, we implemented tech to improve the education of other struggling students. One benefit of web development is that any projects that you make are available to anyone with an internet connection. Despite the digital divide, most individuals have access to the internet, which is beneficial because this allows us to potentially impact everyone with an internet connection. 

I can also use tech to improve my education by creating project based learning projects like the ones we create in AP Computer Science. Our projects improve our own education by increasing our communication skills, collaboration skills, and introducing us to industry standard products like GitHub and Slack. We also learn how to use organizational techniques used in the real world like scrum teams, operation officers, and pair shares. This prepares us for the workforce, and makes us more well-rounded students.
