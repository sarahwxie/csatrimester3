* imperative paradigm: statements that change a programs state >> describes how a program code works
     * Procedural programming: a type of imperative programming in which the program is built from one or more procedures (subroutines/function) >> known in Python
     * structured programming/modular programming: techniques to improve maintainability
* Object Oriented Paradigm: Relies on objects, re-usable blueprints (classes)
     * OOP is: defining classes with a constructor and instance variables, protecting information through encapsulation (setters, getters), extending classes to maximize code reuse, creating subclass-specific behavior through polymorphism

Data Structures
* Arrays/Lists, Dictionaries/Hash Maps >> accompanied by algorithms
