# Week 5 Reflection

This week, for PBL I did login/signup as well as the database. The database is made in accordance to the dbdiagram.io that we made during week 1. I also organized my github pages and redid the formatting.

I chose to do a minimal theme, even though it looks very similar to the defaults, but I like how the fonts look. I created tables and worked in Natashas repo.
