# week 1 reflection

This week I worked on building queues and stacks, and sorting them. It was pretty difficult, as I only realized partway through the week that I shouldn't be using the built in. I first used Mr. Mortensens code, but it was slightly buggy, so I defaulted to using the built in version. I thought the focus would be on the sorting and not on the class, but it was alright. By looking through others' code I realized what I should have been doing, and I learned about how classess can be implemented.
